    <Title>Rat liver treated by PCN</Title>
    <Description>The combination analyses of transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics in rat liver after repeated oral doses of PXR agonist, PCN, for 7 days were conducted to understand the roles for PXR on non-genotoxic signaling and energy homeostasis. mRNA and proteins in homogenate supernatant, membrane, and cytosolic fractions prepared from the liver were analyzed. </Description>

          <note>Four weeks-old Wistar rats of 3 males for 4 groups were purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. The animals were kept in aluminum cages with acclimation period of 7 days. The animals for each group receive 0 (vehicle control of corn oil), or 100 mg/kg/day of PCN by gavage for 7 days. After 7 days of dosing period, the rats were sacrificed by breeding after anesthesia with isoflurane, and the liver was dissected out.</note>

The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g, and the homogenate supernatant fractions were obtained from the supernatants. A part of the homogenate supernatant fractions were further ultra-centrifuged at 105,000 g to obtain cytosolic fractions from the supernatants. The membrane fractions were prepared from the pellet after washing in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4) with PhosSTOP. Each fraction was diluted with the buffer at 1 µg/mL after protein determination by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with albumin as a standard.</note>

          <note>Four weeks-old Wistar rats of 3 males for 4 groups were purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. The animals were kept in aluminum cages with acclimation period of 7 days. The animals for each group receive 0 (vehicle control of corn oil), or 100 mg/kg/day of PCN by gavage for 7 days. After 7 days of dosing period, the rats were sacrificed by breeding after anesthesia with isoflurane, and the liver was dissected out.</note>

          <note>The homogenate supernatant, membrane, and cytosolic fractions of liver were prepared as follows. The livers of control and 100 mg/kg/day groups were homogenized individually in 3 fold volume of ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.4) with 154 mM potassium chloride and PhosSTOP (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g, and the homogenate supernatant fractions were obtained from the supernatants. A part of the homogenate supernatant fractions were further ultra-centrifuged at 105,000 g to obtain cytosolic fractions from the supernatants. The membrane fractions were prepared from the pellet after washing in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4) with PhosSTOP. Each fraction was diluted with the buffer at 1 µg/mL after protein determination by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with albumin as a standard.</note>

          <note>Four weeks-old Wistar rats of 3 males for 4 groups were purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. The animals were kept in aluminum cages with acclimation period of 7 days. The animals for each group receive 0 (vehicle control of corn oil), or 100 mg/kg/day of PCN by gavage for 7 days.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g, and the homogenate supernatant fractions were obtained from the supernatants. A part of the homogenate supernatant fractions were further ultra-centrifuged at 105,000 g to obtain cytosolic fractions from the supernatants. The membrane fractions were prepared from the pellet after washing in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4) with PhosSTOP.

          <note>Four weeks-old Wistar rats of 3 males for 4 groups were purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. The animals were kept in aluminum cages with acclimation period of 7 days. The animals for each group receive 0 (vehicle control of corn oil), or 100 mg/kg/day of PCN by gavage for 7 days. After 7 days of dosing period, the rats were sacrificed by breeding after anesthesia with isoflurane, and the liver was dissected out.</note>

          <note>The homogenate supernatant, membrane, and cytosolic fractions of liver were prepared as follows. The livers of control and 100 mg/kg/day groups were homogenized individually in 3 fold volume of ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.4) with 154 mM potassium chloride and PhosSTOP (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g, and the homogenate supernatant fractions were obtained from the supernatants. A part of the homogenate supernatant fractions were further ultra-centrifuged at 105,000 g to obtain cytosolic fractions from the supernatants. The membrane fractions were prepared from the pellet after washing in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4) with PhosSTOP. Each fraction was diluted with the buffer at 1 µg/mL after protein determination by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with albumin as a standard.</note>

          <note>Four weeks-old Wistar rats of 3 males for 4 groups were purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. The animals were kept in aluminum cages with acclimation period of 7 days. The animals for each group receive 0 (vehicle control of corn oil), or 100 mg/kg/day of PCN by gavage for 7 days. After 7 days of dosing period, the rats were sacrificed by breeding after anesthesia with isoflurane, and the liver was dissected out.</note>

The livers of control and 100 mg/kg/day groups were homogenized individually in 3 fold volume of ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.4) with 154 mM potassium chloride and PhosSTOP (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g, and the homogenate supernatant fractions were obtained from the supernatants. A part of the homogenate supernatant fractions were further ultra-centrifuged at 105,000 g to obtain cytosolic fractions from the supernatants. The membrane fractions were prepared from the pellet after washing in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4) with PhosSTOP. Each fraction was diluted with the buffer at 1 µg/mL after protein determination by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with albumin as a standard.</note>

          <note>Four weeks-old Wistar rats of 3 males for 4 groups were purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. The animals were kept in aluminum cages with acclimation period of 7 days. The animals for each group receive 0 (vehicle control of corn oil), or 100 mg/kg/day of PCN by gavage for 7 days. After 7 days of dosing period, the rats were sacrificed by breeding after anesthesia with isoflurane, and the liver was dissected out.</note>

The livers of control and 100 mg/kg/day groups were homogenized individually in 3 fold volume of ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.4) with 154 mM potassium chloride and PhosSTOP (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g, and the homogenate supernatant fractions were obtained from the supernatants. A part of the homogenate supernatant fractions were further ultra-centrifuged at 105,000 g to obtain cytosolic fractions from the supernatants. The membrane fractions were prepared from the pellet after washing in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4) with PhosSTOP. Each fraction was diluted with the buffer at 1 µg/mL after protein determination by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with albumin as a standard.</note>

          <note>Four weeks-old Wistar rats of 3 males for 4 groups were purchased from Japan Laboratory Animals, Inc. The animals were kept in aluminum cages with acclimation period of 7 days. The animals for each group receive 0 (vehicle control of corn oil), or 100 mg/kg/day of PCN by gavage for 7 days. After 7 days of dosing period, the rats were sacrificed by breeding after anesthesia with isoflurane, and the liver was dissected out.</note>
