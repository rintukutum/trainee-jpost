    <Title>Mouse liver and kidney proteome with antibiotics treatment</Title>
    <Description>Dysbiosis (alteration of intestinal flora) is associated with various host physiologies, including diseases. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of dysbiosis on protein expression levels in mouse liver and kidney by quantitative proteomic analysis, focusing in particular on drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in order to investigate the potential impact of dysbiosis on drug pharmacokinetics.</Description>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>Ten-week-old C57BL/6NJcl male mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were housed individually with free access to food (CE-2, CLEA Japan) and water. Vancomycin hydrochloride (500 mg/L) and polymyxin B sulfate (100 mg/L) were added to the drinking water for 5 days. At the end of treatment, the livers and kidneys were collected (without food deprivation) and frozen using liquid nitrogen.</note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>Ten-week-old C57BL/6NJcl male mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were housed individually with free access to food (CE-2, CLEA Japan) and water. Vancomycin hydrochloride (500 mg/L) and polymyxin B sulfate (100 mg/L) were added to the drinking water for 5 days. At the end of treatment, the livers and kidneys were collected (without food deprivation) and frozen using liquid nitrogen.</note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>Ten-week-old C57BL/6NJcl male mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were housed individually with free access to food (CE-2, CLEA Japan) and water. Vancomycin hydrochloride (500 mg/L) and polymyxin B sulfate (100 mg/L) were added to the drinking water for 5 days. At the end of treatment, the livers and kidneys were collected (without food deprivation) and frozen using liquid nitrogen</note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C.

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>

For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C.

          <note>Ten-week-old C57BL/6NJcl male mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were housed individually with free access to food (CE-2, CLEA Japan) and water. Vancomycin hydrochloride (500 mg/L) and polymyxin B sulfate (100 mg/L) were added to the drinking water for 5 days. At the end of treatment, the livers and kidneys were collected (without food deprivation) and frozen using liquid nitrogen.</note>

          <note>For proteomic analysis, cytosol, crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from 50 mg of minced liver and kidney using the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit. The fractionation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications, i.e., purification by centrifugation at 700 g after the homogenization step was conducted twice to increase the purity of the fractions. For Cyp2b enzyme activity determination, microsomal fraction was prepared from 250 mg of minced liver. The minced liver was homogenized in 1 mL 1.15% KCl solution using a Micro Smash MS-100R (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) under cooling. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in suspension buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). </note>
